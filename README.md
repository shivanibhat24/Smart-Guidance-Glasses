# Smart-Guidance-Glasses

Hi everyone! This is a hardware cum software project.

These smart guidance glasses are used for facial recognition.

We use the internal python facial recognition library.

After successful connection between the server and the client, we can expect recognition within 2.51 s.

Technologies used: Blender, Micropython, Python.

Hardware requirements: Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi Camera (required for input:recognition of the face) and a Bluetooth output device like a speaker or earphone and an SD Card (32 GB suffices for this project).

Upon successfully logging in to the system in Raspberry Pi, do not forget to initialise your Audio Output and Camera.

Happy Coding!
